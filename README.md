# BikeSharing
## Overview
When trying to sell a bikesharing venture to investors in Des Moines we wished to show how well the buisness model does in NYC.
The following analysis is for the stakeholders to see more of the bike-sharing results.

Within the Storyboard the charts have descriptions of the results and what is being depicted in them.

## Summary

Overall the bikes see the most usage during the during the week from the hours of 6am-9am and 4pm-7pm. Additionally, most of the bikes are only rented out for
short periods of time. Many of the bikes also tend to start and end in the same areas/locations.
This information from the charts led me to belived that many of the bikes were used to get to and from work. Moreover, all the charts show that males use
the bike-sharing service the most. Finally, the bike-sharing in NYC has a larger number of subscribers than one time customers which shows much of the permanent population
within the city utilizes this service and not just tourists.

### Future Charts
- Start Station ID/Name

It would be useful to see which station sees the most traffic. This would be good to know when stocking locations with bikes. A chart filtered by number of rides and
from which station would be able to show us this information.

- End Station ID/Name 

When picking up bikes to restock the popular starting locations it would be good to know the popular ending locations for riders.
