# BikeSharing
## Overview
When trying to sell a bikesharing venture to investors in Des Moines we wished to show how well the buisness model does in NYC.
The following analysis is for the stakeholders to see more of the bike-sharing results.

## Results

1. Checkout Times

	- The Citibikes seem to be used for 0-1 hour with fewer bikes staying rented out for longer than that
	amount of time.

2. August Peak Hours
![August_Peak_Hours.png](https://github.com/Tbrads325/BikeSharing/blob/main/images/August_Peak_Hours.png)
	- Middle of the day during buisness hours is when we would expect to see high usage of the bikes which is affirmed in
	this chart. Thus, we can expect for repairs to occur between the hours of 3am-5am.

3. Trips by Weekday heatmap

	- From 6am-9am and from 4pm-7pm the Citibikes see a lot of usage during the weekdays. It is possible that these could be individuals
	utilizing the Citibikes to get to and from work. Additionally, the bikes on the weekends see an uptick in usage between the hours of 10am-7pm.
	This could just be people getting up later on days off and going around the city or individuals coming in to visit NYC on their days off.

4. Gender usage times
![Gender_usage_times.png](https://github.com/Tbrads325/BikeSharing/blob/main/images/Gender_usage_times.png)
	- It seems like more males use the Citibike service, however all genders seem to utilize the bikes for the same period of time. As described previously
	most trips seem to last betwen 0-1 hour.

5. Gender Stoptimes/usages
![Gender_stop_usage.png](https://github.com/Tbrads325/BikeSharing/blob/main/images/Gender_stop_usage.png)
	- This heatmap shows the same pattern described in the previous heatmap, but simply divided by gender this time. This highlights again how males tend to
	use the bike-sharing service more.

6. Gender/Subscribers
![Gender_Sub.png](https://github.com/Tbrads325/BikeSharing/blob/main/images/Gender_Sub.png)
	- The bike-sharing service seems to do pretty well when it comes to subscribers with more of its rides/checkouts coming from subscribers. Meanwhile, this chart 
	shows again more males are utilizing the bike-sharing service.

7. Start and Ending Locations
![Start_and_Ending_Locations.png](https://github.com/Tbrads325/BikeSharing/blob/main/images/Start_and_Ending_Locations.png)
	- As can be seen the bikes stay relatively in the same area. Thus, collecting them for repairs shouldn't be too difficult of a task. Moreover, they will be readily
	available for the same people to use them after dropping them off.

Within the Storyboard the charts have descriptions of the results and what is being depicted in them.

## Summary

Overall the bikes see the most usage during the during the week from the hours of 6am-9am and 4pm-7pm. Additionally, most of the bikes are only rented out for
short periods of time. Many of the bikes also tend to start and end in the same areas/locations.
This information from the charts led me to belived that many of the bikes were used to get to and from work. Moreover, all the charts show that males use
the bike-sharing service the most. Finally, the bike-sharing in NYC has a larger number of subscribers than one time customers which shows much of the permanent population
within the city utilizes this service and not just tourists.

### Future Charts
- Start Station ID/Name

It would be useful to see which station sees the most traffic. This would be good to know when stocking locations with bikes. A chart filtered by number of rides and
from which station would be able to show us this information.

- End Station ID/Name 

When picking up bikes to restock the popular starting locations it would be good to know the popular ending locations for riders.
